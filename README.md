This program only works with ide for the time being. When I try to execute from cmd, I get 
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils
```
I couldn't work around this exception with command line. In the future, I hope I will resolve this problam. But for now I'll keep it that way.

The program is simple. It manages the screenshot folder. You don't need to specift it yourself. It is embedded in the code. You just input the address and the name of your folder.
As long as program runs, every screenshot you take will be moved to the specific folder that you created.
